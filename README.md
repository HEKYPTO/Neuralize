# Neuralize

## Overview
The Neuron Container project provides a simple implementation of a neural network neuron container in Java. It includes a `Neuron` class that represents individual neurons with their weights, biases, and other properties.

## Contents
- `Neuron.java`: This file contains the implementation of the `Neuron` class, which encapsulates the properties and behavior of a neuron in a neural network.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions on how to use it.

## Usage
To use the `Neuron` class in your Java project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `Neuron.java` file into your project directory.
2. Import the `Neuron` class into your Java files where you need to use it.
3. Instantiate `Neuron` objects with the desired parameters to represent neurons in your neural network.

Example usage:
```java
// Create a neuron with specified weights and bias
double[] weights = {0.5, -0.3, 0.2};
double bias = 0.1;
Neuron neuron = new Neuron(weights, bias);

// Alternatively, create an input neuron with a specified value
double inputValue = 0.8;
Neuron inputNeuron = new Neuron(inputValue);
```
